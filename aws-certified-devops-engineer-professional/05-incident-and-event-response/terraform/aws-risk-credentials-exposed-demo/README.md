# AWS Health AWS_RISK_CREDENTIALS_EXPOSED

This example demonstrates how to use [AWS Step Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/) to orchestrate a serverless [AWS Lambda](http://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) workflow in response to an [Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) Event generated by [AWS Health](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/what-is-aws-health.html).

AWS proactively monitors popular code repository sites for exposed AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) access keys. On detection of an exposed IAM access key, AWS Health generates an AWS_RISK_CREDENTIALS_EXPOSED CloudWatch Event. In response to this event, an automated workflow deletes the exposed IAM Access Key, summarizes the recent API activity for the exposed key, and sends the summary message to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) Topic to notify the subscribers- all orchestrated by an AWS Step Functions state machine.

This repository contains sample code for all the Lambda functions depicted in the diagram below as well as an AWS CloudFormation template for creating the functions and related resources.

### Walkthrough of the Architecture
1. An IAM Access Key is inadvertently uploaded to one of the popular code repositories monitored by AWS.
1. AWS Health detects the key, generating a AWS_RISK_CREDENTIALS_EXPOSED CloudWatch Event. AWS also temporarily restricts the API calls the key is able to make.
1. A configured CloudWatch Events rule matches this event, triggering an execution of the `ExposedKey` state machine, which has the following sub-steps:
    * Delete the exposed IAM Access Key Pair. If there is an error in this step then skip to the last step.
    * Summarize recent API activity for the user from CloudTrail.
    * Send security notification message containing summary to `SecurityNotificationTopic` SNS Topic. If there was an error in the first step the notify security that error occurred and incident requires manual inspection and intervention.


## Running the Example

#### Option 1: Apply terraform demo in US East - Ohio (us-east-2)
The backend infrastructure can be deployed in US East - Ohio (us-east-2) using the provided CloudFormation template.
Click **Launch Stack** to launch the template in the US East - Ohio (us-east-2) region in your account:

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LuisCusihuaman/SRE.git
cd aws-certified-devops-engineer-professional/05-incident-and-event-response/terraform/aws_risk_credentials_exposed  
```

View the resources created within the demo

```bash
terraform plan
```
Last, deploy the stack through the Terraform with command line:

```bash
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

## Testing the Example
To test the example without exposing an IAM Access Key to a public repository you can simulate the workflow by executing the `ExposedKey-XXXXXXXXXXXX` state machine with a set of test json for the event. To do this follow the steps detailed below.

Ensure you have at least one E-mail address [subscribed](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/SubscribeTopic.html) to the `SecurityNotificationTopic` created by the template to receive the notification.

1. Go to the [Identity & Access Management](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home) console
1. Go to `Users`
1. Click `Add User` and create a user with programmatic access
    * For the `User name` put `test-user`
    * For `Access type` select `Programmatic access`
    * **Do not set any permissions for the user**
    * Note the `Access key ID` from the Review page for later use in the test json
1. Go to the [Step Functions](https://console.aws.amazon.com/states/home?region=us-east-1#/) console
1. Select the `ExposedKey` state machine
1. Click `New execution` to create the test execution of the state machine
    * Copy and paste the json below to the execution json field
    * Replace `ACCESS_KEY_ID_HERE` with the `Access key ID` noted from the earlier creation of `test-user`
    * You do not need to enter an execution id as one will be randomly generated by default
```json
{
    "version": "0",
    "id": "121345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012",
    "detail-type": "AWS Health Event",
    "source": "aws.health",
    "account": "YOUR_NUMBER_AWS_ACCOUNT",
    "time": "2016-06-05T06:27:57Z",
    "region": "us-east-2",
    "resources": [],
    "detail": {
        "eventArn": "arn:aws:health:us-east-2::event/AWS_RISK_CREDENTIALS_EXPOSED_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
        "service": "RISK",
        "eventTypeCode": "AWS_RISK_CREDENTIALS_EXPOSED",
        "eventTypeCategory": "issue",
        "startTime": "Sat, 05 Jun 2016 15:10:09 GMT",
        "eventDescription": [
            {
                "language": "en_US",
                "latestDescription": "A description of the event will be provided here"
            }
        ],
        "affectedEntities": [
            {
                "entityValue": "ACCESS_KEY_ID_HERE"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

You can follow the state machine's progress in the Step Functions console. The summary message for `test-user` will be sent to the e-mail address(es) subscribed to the `SecurityNotificationTopic` SNS Topic.

Once you have received the notification e-mail you can return to the IAM console to verify that the key created for `test-user` has been deleted.

* **Note that the summary for this user will likely be empty as it will not have logged any API calls to CloudTrail**

Here is an example of what this message might look like for a user who has made recent API calls to IAM and Step Functions:

```
At DETECTED_TIME the IAM access key ACCESS_KEY_ID for user USERNAME on account ACCOUNT_ID was deleted after it was found to have been publicly exposed on the internet.
Below are summaries of the most recent actions, resource names, and resource types associated with this user over the last 24 hours.

Actions:
        PutRolePolicy: 16
        CreateRole: 10
        DeleteRolePolicy: 10
        DeleteRole: 8
        CreateStateMachine: 2
        DeleteStateMachine: 1
        StartExecution: 1

Resource Names:
        SomeResourceName: 10
        SomeOtherResourceName: 39

Resource Types:
        AWS::IAM::Role: 64
        AWS::IAM::Policy: 26

These are summaries of only the most recent API calls made by this user. Please ensure your account remains secure by further reviewing the API calls made by this user in CloudTrail.
```

To see how the state machine catchs the failure to delete the IAM access key in the first step use the same JSON from the previous test with the now deleted IAM access key. Because the access key has already been deleted the `DeleteAccessKeyPair` state raises an error and skips to the `NotifySecurity` state due to the [catch configuration](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/amazon-states-language-errors.html#amazon-states-language-fallback-states) specified in the task. The `NotifySecurity` state detects the injected error message and notifies your security team that there was an error deleting the key so manual inspection and intervention is required. Here is an example of the error message:

```
An error occured when attempting to delete an exposed IAM access key for one of your IAM users. Please login to your account and navigate to the Personal Health Dashboard for more details on this incident and how to resolve it.
