 <h1 align="center"> SRE PORTFOLIO </h1>

In this repository I'll demonstrate all the experience that I've built on my own, through courses, books and creating my own SRE / DevOps / Cloud Computing demos

## ðŸš€ Projects Structure

I implemented, managed, and automated continuous delivery systems and methodologies, security controls, governance processes, and compliance validation in this module.

I defined and deployed monitoring, metrics, logging, and highly available systems, scalable and self-healing on the AWS platform.

-   ðŸ“‚ [**aws\-certified\-devops\-engineer\-professional**](https://github.com/LuisCusihuaman/SRE/tree/master/aws-certified-devops-engineer-professional)

I learned infrastructure as code tools, including configuration management, server templating, orchestration, and provisioning tools.

I built production-grade infrastructure with Terraform small, composable, testable, and releasable modules avoiding common gotchas and pitfalls.

-   ðŸ“‚ [**terraform\-up\-and\-running**](https://github.com/LuisCusihuaman/SRE/tree/master/terraform-up-and-running)

I automated software provisioning, configuration management and used Ansible as a deployment and orchestration tool.

Following best practices for cloud environment inventories, troubleshooting issues triggered during Ansible playbook runs.

-   ðŸ“‚ [**practical-ansible-2**](https://github.com/LuisCusihuaman/SRE/tree/master/practical-ansible-2)

I built in AWS Cloud Development Kit a continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline to keep apps up to date.

Following DevOps principles to take full advantage of the AWS stack and services.

-   ðŸ“‚ [**effective-devops-with-aws**](https://github.com/LuisCusihuaman/SRE/tree/master/effective-devops-with-aws)

I learned how to write, run, and deploy serverless scalable applications and cost-efficient systems in Amazon Web Services.

Build and deploy serverless applications with Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda functions following best practices using Serverless Framework

-   ðŸ“‚ [**aws-serverless-computing**](https://github.com/LuisCusihuaman/SRE/tree/master/aws-serverless-computing)

Here information about aws-serverless-computing book
