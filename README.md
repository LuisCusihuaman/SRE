 <h1 align="center"> SRE PORTFOLIO </h1>

In this repository I'll demonstrate all the experience that I've built on my own, through courses, books and creating my own SRE / DevOps / Cloud Computing demos

## 🚀 Projects Structure

I implemented, managed, and automated continuous delivery systems and methodologies, security controls, governance processes, and compliance validation in this module.

I defined and deployed monitoring, metrics, logging, and highly available systems, scalable and self-healing on the AWS platform.

I learned infrastructure as code tools, including configuration management, server templating, orchestration, and provisioning tools.

I built production-grade infrastructure with Terraform small, composable, testable, and releasable modules avoiding common gotchas and pitfalls.

-   📂 [**terraform\-up\-and\-running**](https://github.com/LuisCusihuaman/SRE/tree/master/terraform-up-and-running)

I automated software provisioning, configuration management and used Ansible as a deployment and orchestration tool.

Following best practices for cloud environment inventories, troubleshooting issues triggered during Ansible playbook runs.
